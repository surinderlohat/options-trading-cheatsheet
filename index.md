As an **option buyer**, you must be very strategic — because time decay and wrong direction can eat your capital quickly. Here's a **focused learning path** tailored **only for option buyers**, especially intraday or short-term traders like you:

---

## 📚 What You Must Learn as an Option Buyer:

### ✅ 1. **Directional Analysis** (Trend Pehle Pakdo)

* Learn to answer: **Market upar jayega ya neeche?**
* Tools to master:

  * **Price Action (Support/Resistance zones)**
  * **Moving Averages (especially VWAP)**
  * **RSI, MACD, Supertrend**
  * **Candlestick Patterns** (breakout/breakdown)

---

### ✅ 2. **Momentum Confirmation**

* Don't just find direction — find **momentum in that direction**.
* Learn:

  * **ADX** > 20 = trending
  * RSI rising from 40 = bullish momentum
  * Volume + breakout = high conviction
* Wait for **breakout + confirmation**, not just guesswork.

---

### ✅ 3. **Option Chain Reading (Live Sentiment)**

* Focus on:

  * **Call Writing = Resistance** → Good for buying Put
  * **Put Writing = Support** → Good for buying Call
  * **High OI buildup zones**
  * **PCR (Put/Call Ratio)** → 0.7 bearish, 1.2 bullish

---

### ✅ 4. **Choose the Right Strike**

* Best for Intraday:

  * **ATM or 1 strike OTM**
  * Avoid far OTM — cheaper but very low delta (won't move much)
* Learn the effect of:

  * **Delta (speed of option move)**
  * **Theta (time decay)**

---

### ✅ 5. **Entry Timing (Market Timezones)**

* Best windows:

  * **9:20–11:30 AM**
  * **1:30–2:30 PM**
* Avoid entering after 2:45 PM unless you're closing a position

---

### ✅ 6. **Exit Strategy & Risk Management**

* Define **target & stop-loss** **before entry**:

  * Example: ₹20 stop loss, ₹40–60 target
* Never hope & hold — **Time decay will kill you** if wrong
* Learn to exit if:

  * Trend changes
  * VWAP is broken in opposite direction

---

### ✅ 7. **Psychology & Discipline**

* Most important: **Follow system. No emotions.**
* If 2–3 trades fail in a row — take a break. Don't revenge trade.
* Learn journaling to track what works.
