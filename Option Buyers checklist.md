### ✅ **How to Use (Step-by-Step for Intraday Option Buy)**

1. **Mark Key S/R Levels** (pre-market or during live session)
2. **Watch RSI**

   * Below 30: Look for CALL setup
   * Above 70: Look for PUT setup
3. **Check PCR (Live from NSE or Sensibull)**

   * PCR > 1 = Favor CALLs
   * PCR < 1 = Favor PUTs
4. **Observe Open Interest**

   * Use OI charts (e.g., Sensibull/Upstox)
   * High OI at a strike = Resistance/Support
5. **Wait for a Candlestick Signal** at S/R

   * Engulfing / Hammer / Doji etc.
6. **Confirm with Volume Spike**

### 🧠 Pro Tips for Option Buyers

* 📆 **Avoid entering trades after 2:30 PM** unless very confident — theta decay hurts.
* 🔥 **Combine this checklist with VWAP** for high-probability scalping.
* 💣 **Avoid sideways zones** (low PCR + flat OI) — options lose value quickly.
